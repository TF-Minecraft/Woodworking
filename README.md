Technical documentation is maintained in [TF-Minecraft/docs](https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/docs/tree/main/projects/woodworking).

Use that project index for setup, configuration, architecture, integration and testing guides. This repository contains the source and project-specific assets.

## TLibs build dependency

TLibs is a versioned Maven `provided` dependency. From this repository, prepare
it once with the shared installer, then build as usual:

```sh
python3 ../tlibs/tools/install-dependency.py --pom pom.xml
mvn clean verify
```

See [TLibs dependency setup](https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/TLibs/blob/804728d2c0d62d64e3194bcdeffc3708acfbc514/DEPENDENCIES.md)
for private-source access, offline installation and the pinned binary versions.
Other declared build dependencies still need their usual preparation.
Use JDK 25 for this TLibs binary; the server must also run Java 25.
